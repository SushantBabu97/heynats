## 🔧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required tools
go version    # 1.26+
node --version # 22+
pnpm --version

# Required for development (enforces code quality)
lefthook --version # For Git hooks - REQUIRED for conventional commits
commitlint --version # For commit message validation - REQUIRED

# Optional but recommended
air --version     # For Go hot reload
```

> **⚠️ Important**: Lefthook + Commitlint are **required** for development as they enforce:
> - Conventional commit message format (commitlint)
> - Code linting and formatting (lefthook)
> - Pre-commit quality checks (lefthook)
> - Prevents commits that don't meet project standards

### Setup Instructions

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heynats.git
   cd heynats
   
   # Add upstream remote
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Astergaze-Solutions/heynats.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install all dependencies
   make install
   
   # Or manually:
   go mod tidy
   cd client && pnpm install && cd ..
   ```

3. **Setup Development Tools (REQUIRED)**
   ```bash
   # Install commitlint (REQUIRED - validates commit messages)
   npm install -g @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
   
   # Install lefthook (REQUIRED - enforces commit standards)
   go install github.com/evilmartians/lefthook@latest
   
   # Install Git hooks - THIS IS MANDATORY
   lefthook install
   
   # Install optional development tools
   go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest  # For Go hot reload
   ```

   > **🔒 What these tools do:**
   > - **Commitlint**: Validates commit message format against conventional commits
   > - **Lefthook**: Orchestrates Git hooks and runs quality checks
   >   - **Pre-commit**: Runs linting, formatting, and tests
   >   - **Commit-msg**: Calls commitlint to validate message format
   >   - **Pre-push**: Runs additional quality checks
   > - **Prevents**: Bad commits from entering the repository

   **After installation, your commits will be automatically validated:**
   ```bash
   # ✅ This will work
   git commit -m "feat(api): add stream deletion endpoint"
   
   # ❌ This will be rejected
   git commit -m "fixed some stuff"
   ```

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   # Start both frontend and backend with hot reload
   make dev-full
   
   # Or separately:
   make dev          # Frontend only (React dev server)
   make dev-server   # Backend only (with air hot reload)
   ```

### Development URLs

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (React dev server)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000 (Go server)
- **Production Build**: http://localhost:5000 (serves both)

### 🔧 Development Tools Troubleshooting

**If commit validation is not working:**
```bash
# Check if commitlint is installed
commitlint --version

# Test commit message validation
echo "feat: add new feature" | commitlint

# Check if lefthook is installed
lefthook version

# Reinstall hooks
lefthook install

# Check hook configuration
lefthook run pre-commit --verbose

# Skip hooks temporarily (NOT recommended)
git commit -m "message" --no-verify
```

**Common validation failures:**
- ❌ **Commit message format**: Must follow `type(scope): description` (validated by commitlint)
- ❌ **Linting errors**: Fix with `make lint` or `pnpm lint`
- ❌ **Test failures**: All tests must pass before commit
- ❌ **Formatting**: Run `gofmt` or `prettier` to fix
- ❌ **Commitlint not found**: Install with `npm install -g @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional`

## 📏 Coding Standards

### Go Backend

```go
// Use gofmt and goimports
go fmt ./...
goimports -w .

// Follow effective Go guidelines
// Use meaningful names
// Add comments for exported functions
// Handle errors properly

// Example function structure:
// GetStreams retrieves all JetStream streams for a given connection
func (c *Client) GetStreams(ctx context.Context, connectionID string) ([]StreamInfo, error) {
    if connectionID == "" {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("connection ID is required")
    }
    // Implementation...
}
```

### TypeScript Frontend

```typescript
// Use consistent naming conventions
// PascalCase for components, interfaces, types
// camelCase for variables, functions
// SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants

// Example component structure:
interface ConnectionCardProps {
  connection: Connection;
  onEdit: (id: string) => void;
  onDelete: (id: string) => void;
}

export function ConnectionCard({ connection, onEdit, onDelete }: ConnectionCardProps) {
  // Implementation...
}

// Use TypeScript strictly
// No 'any' types unless absolutely necessary
// Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
```

### General Guidelines

- **Formatting**: Use project's ESLint/Prettier/gofmt configuration
- **Documentation**: Document public APIs and complex logic
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of changes
- **Security**: Follow security best practices

## 📝 Commit Guidelines

> **🔒 Enforced by Lefthook**: These commit standards are automatically enforced by our Git hooks. Invalid commits will be rejected.

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): subject
